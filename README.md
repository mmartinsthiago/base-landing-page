# What I Do:
This script checks if you have **npm** and **PHP** installed. If any of them is missing, it attempts to install them automatically.

# What I Include:
* Bootstrap and jQuery;
* A customizable css/blp.scss to simplify CSS editing;
* A sample HTML landing page to use as a base;
* A hidden *h1* element for SEO purposes;
* A Patreon link;
* An animated logo;
* An array of social media icons (<social_media>-logo.svg) with hover effects (URLs must be configured);
* A footer with copyright.
